        <h2>What is Forest Bathing?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Taken from the Japanese term “shinrin-yoku”, forest bathing refers to a practice of engaging in mindfulness and meditation whilst walking in nature areas, such as forests! The essence of this practice lies in the use of all senses to absorb and meditate on the environment around oneself. </p>

        <h2>Why I love to Bathe in the Forest</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Forest bathing is a way for me to detach from the stresses of daily life, and plays an important role in my meditation practice. </p>

        <h2>Where to Begin</h2>
        <br>
        <p>It’s easy! Whether you live in a city or rural area, go find a spot of nature. It could be a forest trail, or a public park, or a field, or a beach. Walk around and think about the living things surrounding you. Touch a plant. Close your eyes and focus on what you hear or smell. Just a moment of mindfulness in nature is enough to lower stress and increase your cortisol levels!</p>
